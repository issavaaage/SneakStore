               <div class="all">
                <p>For several years now, sneakers have set the tone for fashion shows and street style blogs. But to say that sneakers are in trend is wrong. Their popularity has long gone beyond the momentary fashion. Sneakers with us for a long time. Probably forever. They repeated the fate of the “trench coat” of British soldiers and the unkillable trousers of American farmers. Following the trench coat and jeans, the sneakers moved from the “practical and comfortable” category to the “stylish and beautiful” category.</p>
                <p>Sneakers outside the sports style sneakers made back in the 1980s. But why did a crushing victory over boats, ankle boots, oxfords, brogues and loafers become possible only now? Probably the fact is that the sneakers coincided with the main global trends of the 2010s. Everything that a modern person is interested in is conveniently done in sneakers.</p>

                 <p>Air Jordan I turned the world of basketball sneakers upside down. They filled this world with color in the truest sense of the word. At that time, players had to enter the court only in plain white sneakers, and therefore every match during which Michael played in black and red Jordans was fined $ 5,000. And so every game throughout the 1985 season! “Devilish” were not only the colors of the sneakers, but also the indicators of the player himself. Michael made a loud statement about himself in the league, won the status of the best rookie of the season, took part in the All-Star Game of the NBA, showed incredible performance based on the results of his games - in a word, blew up the world of basketball. The popularity of Jordan and his sneakers grew at a cosmic speed.</p>
                 <p>Since then, people began to perceive sports shoes differently. Not surprisingly, Air Jordan I, which at that time cost $ 65, becoming the most expensive basketball shoe on the market, was nevertheless extremely popular.</p>

                 <p>Adidas Spezial dates back to 1979 and was originally intended for handball players. For this, a special sole structure is made, which does not allow the player to slip during sudden movements. The first model was made of blue suede with white stripes and was called adidas Handball Spezial. Handball players from Germany, Holland and the Scandinavian countries were the first to choose new sports shoes. Spezial handballs were originally produced in red-white, white-black, or white-blue color combinations, but the choice later expanded.</p>
                 <p>In the 1980s, British football fans from the casuals subculture helped the Spezial silhouette become an integral part of their image. Football hooligans liked the comfort of shoes, their athletic aesthetics, plus they look great along with jeans and other popular outfits of the men's wardrobe of the 80s.</p>

                 <img id="cortez" src="/prodg/img/cortez.jpg">
                 <p>Nike Cortez, without them, there would be no Air Max, Air Jordan, Flyknit, as well as many other lines and technologies. Nike Cortez - the first running shoes of the brand, launched into mass production. From sports tracks, they crossed to the streets, becoming an integral part of Nike's success: over 45 years, hundreds of variations of the cult silhouette have appeared, and new models are released to this day. Telling the story of Nike Cortez means a lot to tell the story of the founding of the company.</p>
                 <p>The turning point is the joining forces of aspiring businessman Phil Knight and his acquaintance coach Bill Bowerman. Under the name Blue Ribbon Sports, the duo has imported Onitsuka Tiger sneakers from Japan since 1964, but Bill believed that athletes could be offered a more interesting product. Together with Japanese colleagues, the silhouette of Tiger Corsair, the predecessor of Nike Cortez, was released in 1968. When the Blue Ribbon Sports and Onitsuka Tiger parted ways, Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman retained the right to use the developments.</p>
                 <p>Officially, Nike, Inc. established in 1972, right for the Summer Olympic Games held in Germany. It was a great moment to compete with popular European and Asian brands. As a result, Nike experienced the exponential growth that few experienced before the boom of Internet startups - by 1979, 50% of the running shoe market was occupied, and Cortez was the main reason for this take-off.</p>
                 <p>There are no secrets. Bill knew what the runners needed, and Phil, through the experience of Onitsuka Tiger, understood how to turn dreams into reality. Nike Cortez sneakers were designed for 160 kilometers of training weekly: a thick rubber outsole for strength, a raised heel to prevent Achilles tendon injuries, a lightweight design to reduce fatigue. Now such tricks are used everywhere, but in 1972 the design covered those details that few people thought about.</p>
